    "3) there are differant types of data types, three of them are 1)integer(23) 2)float(23.233) 3)string(\"23\"). integer is a numerical data type  wchich does not contain any values after decimal, and float contain values after the decimal point and finally string is a data type which is given in or taken out in quotation marks. \n",
